						<li>Choose your coach.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>That's it! The professionals that you select to work with will carefully look over your material and personally respond to you, usually within 2 weeks. Your coaching will consist of a video introduction from your coach followed by responses to questions designed to help you improve every aspect of your performance. If you do not receive your coaching within 30 days, you can request a 100% refund.</p>
